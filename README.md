# ðŸŽ® BomberMan Remake


A modern, objectâ€‘oriented recreation of the classic Bomberman built with Unity and C#. The project emphasizes clean architecture, dataâ€‘driven design, and performant gameplay systems that scale.

## Key Features

- Core gameplay: player movement, bomb placement, explosions, destructible tiles, powerâ€‘ups, win/lose states.
- AI: enemy pathfinding with dynamic obstacle avoidance and target acquisition.
- Architecture: componentâ€‘based design, interfaceâ€‘driven contracts, ScriptableObjects for tunable data.
- Performance: pooling for frequently spawned objects, grid queries, and URP rendering optimizations.
- UI/Audio: realâ€‘time HUD updates, feedback systems, BGM/SFX mixing.

## Architecture Overview

- Generic pathfinder (A*/BFS style) over a grid of level blocks; optimized neighbor detection and path reconstruction.
- `ScriptableObject` assets define bombs, enemies, and levels
- Decoupled systems via C# events and interfaces (e.g., `IHittable`), reducing coupling and easing testing.
- Custom serializable dictionary improves Inspector ergonomics for keyed data.
- Object pooling reduces GC pressure; lightweight logs and profiler markers guide optimization.
